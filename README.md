Diabetes Prediction Model

This repository contains a Python-based machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various health metrics. The model utilizes a Decision Tree algorithm implemented using the scikit-learn library.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Handles data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to ensure model accuracy.
Decision Tree Model: Employs a Decision Tree classifier to make predictions based on input features.
Evaluation Metrics: Includes measures like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
Visualization: Visualizes the decision tree structure and performance metrics for better understanding.
Libraries Used:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations and array handling.
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms, including the Decision Tree classifier.
matplotlib: For data visualization and plotting.
